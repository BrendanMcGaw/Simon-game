# Simon-game
Simon-Game is a browser based memory game where you have to memorize the order of colours that flash and for each level click on the colours in the order that you saw them. 

Ex. 

Level 1: Red flashes -- You click red.

Level 2: Blue flashes -- You click red, then blue. 

Etc...

Once lost the game will ask you to press any key to restart the game.
