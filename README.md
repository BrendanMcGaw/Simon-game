Simon-Game is a browser based memory game where you have to memorize the order of colours that flash and for each level click on the colours in the order that you saw them. 

Ex. 

Level 1: ğŸŸ¥ flashes -- You click ğŸŸ¥.

Level 2: ğŸŸ¦ flashes -- You click ğŸŸ¥, then ğŸŸ¦. 

Etc...

Once lost the game will ask you to press any key to restart the game.
